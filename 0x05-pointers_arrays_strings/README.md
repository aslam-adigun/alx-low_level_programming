## C - More functions, more nested loops

| Project name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| `File 0 - 0-reset_to_98.c` | A function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98. |
| `File 1 - 1-swap.c` | A function that swaps the values of two integers. |
| `File 2 - 2-strlen.c` | A function that returns the length of a string. |
| `File 3 - 3-puts.c` | A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout. |
| `File 4 - 4-print_most_numbers.c` | function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. |
| `File 5 - 5-more_numbers.c` | A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line. |
| `File 6 - 6-print_line.c` | A function that draws a straight line in the terminal. |
| `File 7 - 7-print_diagonal.c` | function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal. |
| `File 8 - 8-print_square.c` | A function that prints a square, followed by a new line. |
| `File 9 - 9-fizz_buzz.c` | A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz. |
| `File 10 - 10-print_triangle.c` | A function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line. |
| `File 11 - 100-prime_factor.c` | A program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line. |
| `File 12 - 101-print_number.c` | A function that prints an integer. |
